# Array Cardio Day 1

Used array methods with arrays and objects to solve 8 challenges

## JavaScript concepts

- Array.prototype.filter()
- Array.prototype.map()
- Array.prototype.sort()
- Array.prototype.reduce()

For #5, I used .map to create an array of objects to confirm data, after the challenge had been solved. #8 also used an empty object and then appended keys and values to it as it iterated through the array.
